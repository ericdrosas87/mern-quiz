            answerExplanation: "If it helps, think of the HTML document(web page) as a sheet of paper and HTML is a black sharpie. You can draw things on the paper with the sharpie and perhaps provide some simple styling, but most styling will be applied via CSS - a styling language."

            answerExplanation: "There is some gray area here, but to keep things simple just know that HTML provides what appears on the screen, CSS provides the look, and Javascript provides the how it functions."
